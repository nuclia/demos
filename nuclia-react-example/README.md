# Example of search components written in React and powered by Nuclia

Demo showcasing a simple application allowing to search information in [Nuclia documentation](https://docs.stashify.cloud/docs/).

In the [Knowledge Box](https://docs.stashify.cloud/docs/docs/getting-started/concepts#knowledge-box) used in this demo,
each resource contains a text field corresponding to a page of our [documentation website](https://docs.stashify.cloud/docs/)
and the corresponding URL is stored in the resourceâ€™s `origin` metadata.

This application was built using [React](https://react.dev/) and [@nuclia/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nuclia/core),
and the project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
